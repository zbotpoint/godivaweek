        It’s time for the ANNUAL TOIKE SPELLING EE!
        This isn’t any ordinary spelling bee though, here at the Toike Oike, we’ve collected some of humanity’s most… unique words. This classic event never fails to challenge and stump even the greatest of elementary school students, so we’re hoping you’ll fair at least a little bit better. Get ready to challenge yourselves this Wednesday! Prizes await!
