        The Engineering Society Ombudsperson and Speaker (henceforth, the investigators)
        received complaints against the Engineering Society President, Christopher Kousinioris,
        (henceforth, Chris) alleging he did not fulfill his duty of representing student concerns in
        discussions with the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering (henceforth, Faculty)
        on the new PEY Program proposal. The complaints focused on the statements made by
        Chris at Faculty Council on October 23rd (the meeting where the PEY Program proposal
        was approved) and by extension on the meetings he had with the Faculty prior to Faculty
        Council. The plaintiffs alleged that Chris claimed the student body supported the
        program at Faculty Council and in the meetings prior. They further alleged that the
        student body did not actually support the program.
        Chris responded to these allegations saying he did oppose the program throughout most
        of his meetings with the Faculty, but they were not willing to accept major changes
        despite that. Chris further said that he chose to support the program towards the end of
        discussions as he felt the plan would be approved regardless and wished to preserve
        negotiating relationships with the Faculty. He also denied making the alleged statement
        at Faculty Council but instead said he supported the program as an individual.
        Furthermore, Chris acknowledged that there was a portion of the student body that did
        not support the program and that more consultations should’ve been conducted, but still
        believed that his choice to “back the deal” was in the best interest of students.
        The investigators conducted interviews with the Dean, Vice-Dean Undergraduate and
        Director of the Engineering Career Centre (ECC) to investigate Chris’s role in meetings
        with Faculty. The Dean felt Chris did not support the program and “raised concerns”
        during discussions. The Vice-Dean Undergraduate felt Chris “saw value” in the program
        but expressed concerns against the increased cost. The Director of the ECC felt Chris
        was “consistently critical” of the program.
        The investigators sent out an email to other students present at the Faculty Council
        meeting where the proposal was discussed to investigate what Chris had actually said
        during the meeting. Two students responded, indicating he said something similar to
        what the plaintiffs alleged, although they didn’t remember word-for-word.
        The investigators conducted a survey of the student body, to investigate if they actually
        supported the new program. Of the 985 respondents, 382 stated they were strongly
        against, 262 were against, 160 were neutral, 128 were in favour and 53 were strongly in
        favour. 327 respondents stated that they would not be able to access the new program
        without access to financial support.
