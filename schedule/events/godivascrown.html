        It’s that time of the year again - time for Anais Poirier, Queen of Diamonds, to crown a successor to represent the spirit of Lady Godiva! Come watch each contestant perform a short, creative and possibly entertaining act. Who will the judges and Anais crown as our next Queen of Clubs? Join us in the pit to find out! Don’t miss the chance to witness the new queen click her heels and yell out ‘Queen of Clubs’ for the first time!
